**Keywords:** CS, NCTU, Taiwan / Technical HCI / Psychology / Bass

**Bio:** I am a Master Student in CS, NCTU, Hsinchu, Taiwan. My research interest is Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), especially in technical HCI.

Currently I am working on input technique in virtual reality. I am interesting in exploring the novel input/output user interfaces and actuating human body with the latest techniques.

Besides the research, I like to go to swimming, art museum and live house. Love drinking beer. Sometimes go mountain climbing. Now I am learning how to play bass and enjoy the musics.
