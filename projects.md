                FacePush is a Head-Mounted Display (HMD) integrated with a pulley system to generate normal forces on a user’s face in virtual reality (VR). The mechanism of FacePush is obtained by shifting torques provided by two motors that press upon a user’s face via utilization of a pulley system. FacePush can generate normal forces of varying strengths and apply those to the surface of the face. We develop three applications, including boxing, diving, and 360 guidance in virtual reality.

                We use R package, shiny, to build web application and create interactive graphics to demonstrate statistical concept for students in psychology. Statistical analysis is an important part in educating a psychology student. However, many people still need many effort to understand the materials provided in traditional textbook. We believe the interactive graphics help people to better understand the concept of statistics.

FoodForYou is our final project in User-Centered Interaction Design 2017 Fall.
We create a mobile application prototype, FoodForYou, as a channel to share surplus food with people nearby and take what she/he needs from others’ sharing. User can search their favorite food sharing nearby their location, start a sharing, or participate in one. Unlike existing surplus food and leftover sharing group on social media (e.g. Facebook), FoodForYou contains personalized recommendation system, dealing procedure, and a reputation system to enhance user’s willing to start or participate a surplus food sharing. With the intention of helping people build a support network which will ease the various waste of food. FoodForYou can be a low-cost and efficient solution for surplus food sharing in the future.
